# GitHub Username Finder

This is a React Native mobile app for searching for GitHub user information. It utilizes context for theming (dark & light themes), standard navigation via tabs and sources its data from the official GitHub API.

This project is a step-by-step recreation (in-progress) of [Qiang Hao's project](https://github.com/Neo-Hao/react-native-github-user-search) (which is in turn inspired by [this Frontend Mentor project](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6)). I wanted to better understand his project by coding it myself step-by-step "from scratch".

You can run the app with Expo with `npx expo start` and connect to the Metro bundler with Expo Go or on your computer with an Android simulator/iOS emulator.
